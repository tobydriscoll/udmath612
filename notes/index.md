title: "Notes"

These are course notes written by [Toby Driscoll](http://tobydriscoll.net) at the [University of Delaware](http://udel.edu) for the course MATH 612. They were started in November 2018.

These are a lot rougher than a book! Don't expect perfection. Also, while I use them to guide lectures, they're not meant as a substitute. 

In places I refer to the text *Iterative Methods for Optimization* by C. T. Kelley.
