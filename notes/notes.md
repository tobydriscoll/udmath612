These are course notes written by [Toby Driscoll](http://tobydriscoll.net) at the [University of Delaware](http://udel.edu) for the course MATH 305. They were started in January 2018.

These are a lot rougher than a book! Don't expect perfection. Also, while I use them to guide lectures, they're not meant as a substitute, as I don't follow them slavishly. 

I try to indicate how material is related to the textbook [*Differential Equations*](http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=1118531779&bcsId=9431), 3rd edition, by Brannan and Boyce.
